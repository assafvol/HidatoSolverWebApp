# Hidato Solver By Image

## Description

Hidato Solver By Image is a web application designed to solve Hidato puzzles using images. Hidato is a logic puzzle game where the goal is to fill a grid with consecutive numbers that connect adjacent cells. This tool leverages image processing techniques to extract the Hidato grid from images. Once extracted, the solver utilizes CSP (Constraint Satisfaction Problem)-based techniques to efficiently and accurately solve the Hidato puzzle.

## Usage

To use the Hidato Solver By Image, follow these steps:

1. Access the Web Application - https://assafvol-hidatosolverwebapp-app-1dptmp.streamlit.app/.
2. Upload an image containing a Hidato puzzle.

   **Important Notes:**
   - The Hidato image must be of good quality for accurate processing.
   - The application supports only hexagonal Hidatos.
   - Ensure that the outer border of the Hidato is the largest shape in the image.

3. The application will process the image, extract the Hidato grid, and use CSP-based techniques to solve the puzzle.

   **Additional Tips:**
   - If the solving fails, try again after adjusting the angle of the Hidato by a few degrees in each direction.
